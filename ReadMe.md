MultiTouchMultiResponse
===

### Overview
This is a starter application that helps users trigger responses from the Bare Conductive Touch Board. By responses I mean physical / visual / aural responses. 

For now there are four responses:

* Servo 
* LED
* Audio
* Neopixels

Each response has 3 modes: 

* Switch: is an on / off action, by constantly touching the electrode you keep the response in the on state. Release the electrode and the state changes.

* Toggle: is a touch on action. Touch once to turn on, touch again to turn off.


* Once / Loop: performs one whole function before returning to the normal program loop. For instance: a servo swinging between the defined Angles.
